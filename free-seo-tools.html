  <h1>Free SEO Tools</h1>
  <h2>Here are some key SEO tools we recommend which are completely free to use, or offer free subscriptions.</h2>
  <br>
  <h3>Keyword Research</h3>
  <p>1. Google Ads Keyword Planner</p>
  <p>Although its main purpose surves to help Ad users identify the best keywords to bid for, it offers the best information on keyword impressions and click estimates. As well as offering more detailed information on region and even demographics of the users who search. Not to mention, it's from Google themselves, which makes the informations it provides much more trustworthy then some other free platforms.</p>

  <br><br>
  <h3>Backlink Checker</h3>
  <p>2. Moz's Link Explorer</p>
  <p>You will have to create a free account with Moz.com, but there are no additional charges to using this tool. The link explorer offers the best free information out there on backlink data for any webpage, including your own or competing sites.</p>
  <a href="https://moz.com/link-explorer" target="_blank">Link Explorer</a>
  <br><br>
  <h3>SERPs Analysis</h3>
  <p>3. Local Search Result Checker</p>
  <p>Finding rankings for specific locations on Google can be tricky when Google is constantly trying to serve you personalised local rankings. The Local Search Results Checker, by brightlocal.com, provides a free tool to check the SERPs for a particular keyword for anywhere. It also offers Google Map results as an additional feature.</p>

  <br><br>
  <h3>Mobile Usability</h3>
  <p>4. Mobile Friendly Tester</p>
  <p>Google has been pushing the agenda now for the last few years of improved mobile usability for all websites. With increased internet activity happening on mobile devices each year, and less usage by both desktop and tablet devices, well performing pages on mobile devices is integral for SEO. Therefore Google have provided their very own mobile friendly tester. As part of their Search Engine console, the tester allows page URLs as well as HTML code (if required) to be tested indivdually for their mobile friendliness.</p>

  <br><br>
  <h2>Other Tools</h2>
  <h3>Website Security</h3>
  <p>5. Snyk Website Security Scanner</p>
  <p>Most good quality hosting services now often offer their own firewalls and security protocols; as well as CDNs such as Cloudflare, which will prevent routing traffic to sites which it determines as possible attacks. However, when it comes to digital security you can never be too cautious. Snyk's Vunerability Scanner checks your sites' security headers and potential vunerabilities, and provides some basic analysis as well as information of how to improve your website security.</p>

  <p>Of course we would never suggest relying on online scanners such as this soley for web security testing. Especially if your site has a lot of complex functionality, API calls and restricted database lookups. Synk also offers its own security development platform for a price. And there are many private available web and app security testers who provide security audits for hire.</p>

  <br><br>
  <h3>HTML Status</h3>
  <p>6. Nu Html Checker</p>
  <p>To maintain and build the quality of your website, your site should apply as clean and well coded html and scripts as possible. Evidence of broken or errors in code is often best found within a browsers developer console; even when there is little visible proof viewing the page itself. The html checker, from validator.w3.org, provides fast and easy checks on a web pages HTML, CSS, or SVG document. Simply paste your page's URL, the checker will inform you of any code discrepancies and how to improve/fix them individually.</p>

  <br><br>
  <h3>Page Load Speed</h3>
  <p>7. Web Page Speed Test</p>
  <p>Accessibility and page speed are priority factors in ranking positively in SERPs. The latest Google algorithms favour pages which load quickly and effectively on desktop, tablets and especially mobile devices. The recommended minimum is for a web page to load within at least 3 seconds on a mobile device on a 3G network. Webpage Speed Test allows you to accurately measure your page load time for individual urls. As well as customise the device type and location it can be tested from.</p>

  <br><br>
  <h3>Social Share Links</h3>
  <p>8. Share Link Generator</p>
  <p>Page shares via popular social media sites are a good indication to search engines of the quality of a site's content. To help increase a pages 'sharability', social sharing should be made as accessible as possible. Share Link Generator makes it easy to generate custom share links for pages which can be used with a number of popular social sites.</p>

  <br><br>
  <h3>Campaign Tracking</h3>
  <p>9. Campaign URL Builder</p>
  <p>To help track the efficiency and quality of any promotional campaigns such as email, advertising or social media; custom tracking parameters can be added to sharable links. These custom links (which should perform no differently to the original page link), can help site analytics tools and software (e.g. Google Analytics) to identify where site users have originated from. They can also provide details on which campaigns a site visitor has previously interacted with, and when.</p>

  <p>Identifying the efficiency and quality of campaigns is useful in better understanding user interaction with a site. Another benefit includes discovering the cost effectiveness of any campaign for future optimization and efficient spending. The campaign url builder makes creating custom urls for a number of platforms very quick and simple. By entering in a few simple fields, the generator will provide an easily trackable web link for a chosen site/page, which can be easily inserted where appropriate into any campaign type.</p>
