  <p class="subtitle">Whether you are a seasoned blogger, or a beginner posting your first content, getting to know the key factors in SEO for a blog is important for getting your content as seen as possible and by the right audiences.</p>

  <h2>Why do you need SEO for a blog?</h2>

  <p>SEO (Search Engine Optimization) can enhance your web pages to be more widely available within search engine results pages (SERPs) - such as Google. And can also target your website to be viewed by more appropriate viewers; who will greatly appreciate your site and its purpose/content.</p>

  <div class="quote"><em>&#34;For example, a blog discussing outdoor adventuring may struggle to appear on Google ahead of other sites selling outdoor gear&#46;&#46;&#46;&#46;&#34;</em></div>

  <p>Blogs often can be drowned out by the many other competing sites trying to win viewership. For example, a blog discussing outdoor adventuring may struggle to appear on Google ahead of other sites selling outdoor gear. Or for those searching info on camping tips and tricks, but instead being directed to outdoor camping venues. Whatever your reason for wanting greater viewership on your blog, optimizing your site to be more search engine friendly, and your content to be more targeted is a vital step for improvement.</p>

  <h2>How to improve your blog&#39;s SEO</h2>

  <p>Fortunately, no matter what the subject matter of your blog is, whether it is 10 months old or 10 years old, there are a number of ways to be better optimized for the web.</p>

  <h3>Check your blog&#39;s current SEO status</h3>

  <p>Step one is finding what specific areas of your blog that can be generically improved to help your page&#39;s SEO as a whole. There are many tools and software available, both free and premium, which allow you to identify the weak areas of your site&#39;s SEO health. Sites such as seobility.net analyse your page&#39;s content and structure to recognize where any improvements can be made. Quite often these will be fairly simple changes, which may involve adding more or rearranging some of your page&#39;s content. Other suggestions could include adding additional meta tags to your page to help search engines reference your content more easily. (See more on meta tags and what they do here.)</p>


  <h3>Make sure your blog is as accessible as possible</h3>

  <p>Many search engines (including Google) prioritise content in their search results partially based on how accessible the site is to the reader. This can be measured in a number of ways, including how fast the page fully loads, if your page is &#39;mobile friendly&#39;, and is the content both readable/viewable and easy to navigate for the user.</p>

  <p>Making your blog as concise and as easily digestible as possible to viewers of all mediums will greatly increase your chances of ranking better on the results page. Not to mention the benefits of increased viewing time and greater user interaction across your site. Also, if you rely on paid advertising per page view from your blog, or affiliate link clicks and purchases, increasing the quality of experience on your blog for your users will likely show greater returns in more ways than one. But remember, this is only one step to get increased success in SEO from your pages.</p>

  <h3>Make the content on your page targeted&#46;&#46;&#46; and relevant</h3>

  <p>SEO for a blog is the same largely for SEO of any site. To gain traction with more viewers on your blog and improved search engine rankings, you need at least some posts on your site to include targeted and selective content which is more likely to rank well in result listings.</p>

  <p>Firstly, make sure you choose content which is still relevant to the theme and subject of your blog. Obviously this range will be variable depending on the site. But it would not be advisable, for example, for a sports blog about football to publish content about good cake recipes. Although the two might be good topics to post about individually, it is unlikely football fans looking for posts on sport will also be interested in cake recipes at the same time. This type of over diversification is inefficient, and not very beneficial to your blogs progress.</p>

  <div class="quote"><em>&#34;&#46;&#46;&#46; a post about football boots, could lead users to other content which is more the main focus of your site&#39;s overall theme and/or purpose.&#34;</em></div>

  <p>Producing content however which is related to your blog&#39;s theme or subject, but maybe not as directly related as other posts and pages, can be useful as relevant diversification. For example a post about football boots, could lead users to other content which is more the main focus of your site&#39;s overall theme and/or purpose.</p>

  <p>The topics you choose for this relevant diverse content should be selected from keyword research conducted around the primary basis of your blog. This may sound intimidating to a beginner, however there are many articles, tutorials and discussions to talk you through it available. (See How to do keyword research). There are many keyword research tools available; including Google Ads Keyword Planner for Free (account setup required). By researching search terms related to your blog&#39;s primary themes and topics, try finding keywords and search terms which are popular but not overly competitive. These are the topics which you should create some content for. And then signpost well to other pages on your blog to encourage greater viewership.</p>

  <h3>Measure how well your pages are optimized for key terms</h3>

  <p>When writing or producing any content for a page or post which you want to rank highly within search results, always check that it is thoroughly optimized for the key terms you need.</p>

  <p>Fortunately we offer a free to use Free Keyword Page Grader to help justify your individual page content against specific key terms and phrases. We offer the only free to use keyword page grader on the web. With no sign-up or subscriptions necessary. And we provide helpful bespoke tips and suggestions of how to make your content better optimized for your preferred key terms, and generally improve SEO for your blog.</p>

  <p>Remember, research the key terms and phrases beforehand to know which searches are going to be easier to naturally compete for in the rankings but still get good visibility each month.</p>

  <h3>Present your content as easy to read and digestible</h3>

  <p>Although this may seem as overly obvious or common sense, it&#39;s worth mentioning for the sake of SEO as well. The content you produce on your blog, whether it be written posts or video uploads, should be formatted and presented in a format which is as easy as possible for the user to engage with.</p>

  <p>Well formatted content often gets the best engagement, the most views and better promotion. For this reason you also want to make it as easy as possible for users to show appreciation for your publications. By this we mean sharing on social channels (Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, etc.), embedding or link-sharing with others (WhatsApp, WeChat, etc.), on-page comments, likes, reactions and upvotes&#46;&#46;&#46; and so on. Any form of engagement can be an additional identifier to search engines that your page (and the content on it) has value, and is worth ranking higher.</p>

  <h2>What benefits will SEO for a blog receive?</h2>

  <p>Improving your blog for SEO will naturally help your blog expand. To repeat a statement I mentioned previously, whether you are a small blogger publishing as a hobby or running a dedicated blog for additional income, enhancing your SEO will likely provide increased traffic and greater opportunities with it.</p>

  <h3>Organic traffic is cheaper overall</h3>

  <p>Many bloggers, especially when starting out, can fall into the trap of paid advertising as a method to get users to their sites faster and easier. Although this requires less time and physical investment, it can become costly and not always beneficial in the long term for your blog. Paid advertising can certainly be a quick boost to a site&#39;s development; and even work hand-in-hand with SEO, but only if used correctly.</p>

 <p>Investing in improving SEO to gain organic traffic is often slow in the short term, with very gradual gains. However, eventually you can rely on a much more reliable and natural traffic flow. And it will not continue to cost you for traffic per visit. Something which can be less predictable and unaffordable with increasing competition.</p>

  <h3>Refine your content and on-site experience based on your audience</h3>

  <p>More dedicated users on your blog makes for better target groups and analysis. There are many web analytics services available for websites, apps and software which allow for user behaviour tracking while using your site. Platforms such as Google Analytics, Spring Metrics, Adobe Analytics, etc., all can provide a picture of how web visitors are interacting and engaging with your blog, how effective your blog content is, and how/where you obtained your visitors.</p>

  <div class="quote"><em>&#34;If I can identify my &#39;how to&#39; post about creating homemade dog treats, was visited much more frequently and for longer by web users, than my post on &#39;why my dogs like to eat dog treats&#39;, I know content I publish which is more informative may continue to better on my blog in future.&#34;</em></div>

  <p>Comparable analytics in particular can be useful to bloggers who want to identify where the strengths of their content lies. For example, if I can identify my &#39;how to&#39; post about creating homemade dog treats, was visited much more frequently and for longer by web users, than my post on &#39;why my dogs like to eat dog treats&#39;, I know content I publish which is more informative may continue to better on my blog in future.</p>

  <h2>Things to remember</h2>

  <p>Some final thoughts, always remember SEO for a blog is part of an investment. You are unlikely to see much improvement overnight unless you have an already established blog. But to gain more relevant traffic to your site, without costing you greatly, optimizing for search engines will make a considerable improvement to your site.</p>
